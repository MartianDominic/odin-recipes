    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Hasselback Potatoes are a style of baked potato that was first created in a tavern in Sweden called Hasselbacken. They are a beloved part of Swedish cuisine that have been replicated all over the world into many variations, with uncountable toppings.</p>
    <p>Hasselback potatoes are popular because of their visual appeal. Yet, they also have a lot to offer in taste and texture. The thin rims of skin around each slice turn ultra cripsy and chip-like while baking. However, the interior layers become soft and sumptuous, seasoned with garlic butter, herbs, and spices that pool down between the folds.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Number of servings - 10 | Prep time - 15 min | Cook time - 1 h | Difficulty - Easy</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (or any other starchy potatoes)</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Bacon grease or Olive oil</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>4 springs of fresh Rosemary</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Smash the garlic cloves and peel off the skin. Then pour the bacon grease or oil on the baking sheet and lay the garlic cloves, and rosemary on the sheet pan as well.</li>
      <li>Hold the end of one potato. Use a sharp knife to cut across the potato to create 1/16- to 1/8-inch sections. Do not cut through the potato, but cut two-thirds the way down, leaving at least a 1/2 inch solid base at the bottom. Repeat with the remaining potatoes.</li>
      <li>Place the potatoes on the baking sheet and roll them around to cover them with fat. Set them cut-side-up. Then sprinkle each potato generously with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Roast in the oven for 30 minutes. Then use tongs to gently squeeze the base of each potato to open up the folds. Use a pastry brush to brush the herb-infused pan oils over the top of each potato and in between the folds. Discard the garlic cloves if they are blackened.</li>
      <li>Roast in the oven for another 30 minutes, until the largest potato is fork tender. Serve warm.</li>
